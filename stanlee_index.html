              <h1>Early Life</h1>
              <p>Stanley Martin Lieber was born on December 28, 1922, in Manhattan, New York City. Lee's father, trained as a dress cutter, worked only sporadically after the Great Depression, and the family moved further uptown to Fort Washington Avenue, in Washington Heights, Manhattan. Lee had one younger brother named Larry. Lee attended DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx. In his youth, Lee enjoyed writing and entertained dreams of writing the “Great American Novel” one day. He graduated from high school early, aged sixteen and a half, in 1939 and joined the WPA Federal Theatre Project.</p>

            <h1>Career</h1>
            <p>Lieber, who later shortened his name to “Lee” as a writer, went on to be hired as an office assistant at Timely Comics in 1939 and became an interim editor for the company in the early 1940s. Lee also served domestically in the Army during World War II, working as a writer and illustrator. Following the success of the Fantastic Four, a slew of new characters soon sprung from Lee and his Marvel cohorts, including the Hulk, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Daredevil and the X-Men. In the early 1960s, Lee was called upon by his boss to create a series for Marvel Comics (Timely's new name) that could compete with rival DC Comics' hit title Justice League of America. Citing writing influences like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Jules Verne, and following the encouragement of his wife, Joan, Lee did away with some of the usual superhero conventions. Hence, with artist and co-creator Jack Kirby, the Fantastic Four was born in 1961.</p>

          <h1>Movies</h1>
          <p>Lee is no stranger to cameo appearances in movie adaptations of his Marvel comic book characters. Prior to the MCU, Lee had, in fact, popped up every Marvel movie franchise, from X-Men to Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy. The sheer popularity of the MCU, however, and the creative ways it featured Lee's cameos effectively cemented Lee's appearances as one of the most exciting elements of any given movie. Watching the latest Spider-man: No Way Home, the audience has come to realize once again, just how missed his cameo appearances are. Let us reminisce this mastermind of a man with our ranking list of his best MCU cameo appearances. Lee had cameo appearances in many Marvel film and television projects, including those within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A few of these appearances are self-aware and sometimes reference Lee’s involvement in the creation of certain characters. He additionally voiced a cameo appearance as himself in the 2018 DC Comics movie Teen Titans Go! To the Movies. Out of respect for Lee, Marvel Studios enacted a new policy following his death that forbids cameos by Lee in new films by using archive footage of him, with Avengers: Endgame (2019) marking his final appearance; the film was released several months after his death.</p>
